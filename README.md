2. Running the program would ask the user to enter a line. Go ahead and enter a series of texts.

3. After entering the text, the program asks the user if he/she wants to enter more lines. Enter "y" for yes and "n" for no.

4. The program continues to ask the user to enter more line and if it wants more lines if the user enters "y" when asked. Otherwise, the program will end if the user answer with "n".
